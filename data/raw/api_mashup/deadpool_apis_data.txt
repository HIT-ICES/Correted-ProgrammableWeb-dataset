Requests to the Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) can be embedded to generate images of a global location and the surrounding ocean. Depth and terrain features of the ocean floor are represented as aids to marine navigation, exploration, and research.\nAPI methods support submission of a global location, stated in the request as global tile row and column plus zoom level. The API generates and returns a PNG image of the land and ocean floor topography at the specified location, represented as a digital terrain model with shaded relief and depth readings (soundings).",

To make it happen, he used ESPN API, League Sites API, and MSNBC API, using AJAX, XML, and JSON as data returning formats. He also found a Python component to communicate with the interface. His findings included callbacks for free and for several thousands of dollars from official companies dedicated to access schedules and scores from baseball, basketball, football, and hockey major leagues.

The Backstop SOAP API provides an interface to key objects in Backstop, including contacts, notes/docs/meetings, funds/products, hedge funds/private equity funds, benchmarks, and peer groups.\nThe SOAP API allows one application to request the services of another. It goes beyond simply asking for a piece of data stored in a database; a program with a SOAP API can be asked to execute complex functions (e.g. searching for information, calculating numbers, etc.), the results of which will be returned to the requesting application.\nA software application that integrates with Backstop via the SOAP API can request a range of information about these objects, including return series, balances, qualitative information and more. The most common use of the Backstop SOAP API is to integrate Backstop with proprietary or custom external applications such as analysis and reporting tools. Full documentation for the API is available upon request.",

    "description": "It's about The Concepts\nThe BeliefNetworks service is about discovering concepts locked within data such as unformatted text documents, HTML documents, Word documents, PDF files, RSS feeds and XML representations dumped from databases. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds this simple idea, coupled with automation, which provides a foundation for your next-generation, intelligent web application.\nThe discovery of concepts is fundamental to the BeliefNetworks service. If you are familiar with search text discovery, then consider a starting point of \"I'm a little teapot\". This, in turn, is the basis for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdFinding Not Searching\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Keywords, in this context, have no relevance.\nHowever, that's just scratching the surface. Once DataChasm has mined a document for concepts, or conceptually mapped its concepts, the document becomes a resource for richer search features enabled in applications powered by BeliefNetworks. Up until now, conceptually mapped documents were the potential endpoints of a search scenario, that is, a document to be discovered. However, BeliefNetworks applies an interesting twist by making the conceptually mapped document also the starting point of a search. For example, a conceptually mapped document can be the target of the statement \"Find me all documents that are like this document\". And, as soon as you consider that documents don't have to be literally documents, that they can actually be unstructured information that represents anything in your domain, then the possibilities begin to multiply.\nFinding Not SearchingTM\nImagine you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre trying to find all documents related to a document about \"The History of Military Aircraft\" using a straight-up search appliance. First, you read the document closely, extracting the concepts you believe represent the essence of the document, and then you start a search with those concepts as search keywords. We've already seen an example of the subtle differences between discovery of search keywords and the discovery of higher-level conceptual meaning. What can you expect? You'll probably find a lot documents about camels, for starters.\nWith a BeliefNetworks\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd application, that last step might actually be as simple as \"pushing a button\". The action of that button would extract concepts that you would otherwise be forced to do manually, and then search for other documents that represent similar concepts. With a BeliefNetworks\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd application, if you started with a document on the History of Military Aircraft, you might get results ranging from World War Aircraft and Classic Aircraft to Lethal Aircraft. Bingo.\nRecommendations based on what you know.\nThat was a discovery scenario. Let's think about a recommendation scenario. Suppose you are building an application, the premise of which is that you can provide value to a user base by matching pet owners to pet service providers (groomers, walkers, stables, supplies vendors, etc). Both pet owners and pet service providers can register in your system, but they are two separate groups that are managed separately by your application.\nThere are affinities between the two groups that, if discovered, may lead to greater user satisfaction with your service, good buzz, more customers, and ultimately higher profits for you. For instance, obviously you don't recommend a stable to someone looking for a kennel, but a person looking for a kennel for Roscoe for the weekend may have some particular likes and needs that can be matched to the right kennel with minimal effort for Roscoe's owner.\nIn this case, the \"documents\" scanned for concepts are pet owner profiles they freely enter at registration time describing themselves and their pets (with appropriate confidence the details won't be sold or revealed). Profiles would be fed, as created, into the conceptual mapper. Meanwhile, pet service providers would fill out some forms describing their offerings that ultimately could be rendered as XML documents. As you can see, there are a number of approaches for each major actor in your application.\nNow, imagine a pet-services discovery service powered by BeliefNetworks. The conceptual information for all pet owners is mapped and placed into one silo, and likewise another silo of conceptual information is built for all pet service providers. Finally, we return to Roscoe's owner who pushes a button on the BeliefNetworks\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd powered application to start searching for recommendations in the pet services silo based upon the conceptual information gleaned from their owner's profile.\nIt could also work another way. Suppose you offer anonymous direct marketing, something that would inform pet owners of goods and services but would not expose their personal data to the service providers. This approach would not be as annoying as a phone call, but could be a message on their customer page linking them to the service provider that they can click on if they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre interested. Conversely, the pet service provider, interested in buying a batch of push marketing, pushes a button and your service discovers pet owners most likely to be interested in their products and services by asking BeliefNetworks to match the pet service provider's profile to the most conceptually relevant profiles of pet owners.\nThe DataChasmTM Service\nVersion 1.0 of BeliefNetworks\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd DataChasm\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd web service provides RESTful programmatic conceptual discovery against two large data repositories - The World Wide Web and Twitter. No additional effort is required on the part of the programmer other than to make the call. These two data repositories are most useful for interesting search applications and mashups. As an example, the MashMeUp web application illustrates the functionality of concept discovery with Twitter and web site recommendations.\nThe DataChasm web service also provides the means to build your own silos of conceptual information, closely tuned to your own application business needs. Once built, those silos become the foundation for recommendation features, that until now, you've only wished you could have.\nBut, to use the APIs properly, some conceptual information should be introduced (pun intended).\nConcepts, Concepts, Concepts\nWe started with concepts, and now we return to them. Concepts are key to successful use of the DataChasm service. We like to think of concepts as information thumbnails (actually, we consider them a higher cognitive learning process, but that is another discussion). The habit of pushing simple keyword search, while actionable by the APIs, isn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt as successful as starting with a document that expresses and represents the concepts you are interested in discovering. You'll find many APIs accept a generic \"text\" parameter. This may refer to as little or as much text as you need to represent your concepts, or it can refer to a fully qualified URL which points to a document or resource on the web (think article, publication, XML output from some other API) that encapsulates the concepts. For instance, you may have better results pointing to an article on The Cramps for a punk band search than simply the text \"The Cramps\".\nRecommendations\nA recommendation is the relationship between your starting point (text or URL) and the haystack of information with which you wish to establish an affinity with that starting point in order i to discover the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdneedles\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, sorted for relevance. What BeliefNetworks believes to be the most relevant possibilities are returned first; if you wish, you can go deeper into the stack with successive queries. For instance, when you ask for recommendations from Twitter, you are returned ongoing conversations considered most relevant to your conceptual starting point. We like to call that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtweaning\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd; in other words, bringing meaning to tweeting.\n\"Weight\" is the term we use for the degree of relevance a recommendation has to your chosen starting point. You'll see various weights returned for recommendations, and you can build logic around this such as sorting, cut-off, etc.\nCustom APIs\nOur custom APIs allows you to build applications against your own business data. You can define silos of information by business need, seed them and maintain them with resources, and then query them for recommendations, just like you can with our Twitter and Web APIs. This is a powerful tool that allows you to discover conceptual relationships of the highest relevance against between your own repositories of business data.\nOne Corpus, Many Corpora\nThe \"Corpora\" referred to by BeliefNetworks\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd APIs are your information silos. You create a corpus to hold the results of resources that are related by conceptual consistency. For example, if you were Amazon, one corpus might hold Books, while another might hold Reviewers. A resource list is typically provided at creation time. The corpus resources are subsequently managed and updated as resources come and go. Every 24 hours, DataChasm crawls any new resources for addition to, and removes all those marked for deletion from, your corpus.\nOnce a corpus is created, you may begin to query it for recommendations.",

    "description": "THIS API IS NO LONGER BEING SUPPORTED\nGetSavings API Description\nThe ValueAppeal GetSavings API returns only two possible values, either a 0 or a ValueAppeal Estimated Savings dollar amount. (See Definitions) Advertising partners should only display a ValueAppeal advertisement on their site if a non-zero result is returned.\nIn order to receive a ValueAppeal Estimated Savings dollar amount the following conditions must be met:\n1.\tValueAppeal can correctly match the candidate address to a valid property address in the ValueAppeal property database of approximately 90 million residential property addresses.\n2.\tThe candidate property must be inside the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAppeal Window\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for the relevant jurisdiction. (See Definitions)\n3.\tThe candidate property must be \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOverassessed\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (See Definitions)\nDefinitions:\nJurisdiction\nDepending where the candidate property is located, property tax assessments, property tax rates, and Appeal Windows may be determined at the county level, city level, township level, neighborhood level, or according to arbitrary political jurisdictions within a city. Therefore, the Appeal Window, tax rate, and unique assessor rules can vary dramatically for two homes that are within only a few blocks of each other.\nResidential Property\nValueAppeal offers its service for the following property types: Single Family Residential, Condominiums, and Townhomes.\nValueAppeal does not offer its service for Co-ops, duplexes, triplexes, mobile homes, vacant land, apartment buildings, or any commercial property types.\nAppeal Window\nHomeowners are not allowed to file an appeal of their property tax assessment any time they want throughout the year. A homeowner may only file an appeal of their property tax assessment during a specific period of time each year called the Appeal Window. The typical Appeal Window is only forty five to sixty days out of each year, though it may be as short as twenty five days or as long as nine months. Each jurisdiction across the country has a different length Appeal Window, and occurs at different times throughout the year. Sometimes the Appeal Window is uniform for properties in a particular county. Sometimes the Appeal Window is uniform only at the neighborhood level. By design, the GetSavings API will not tell you whether a candidate property is inside its Appeal Window or not.\nOverassessed\nValueAppeal\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds proprietary, patent pending, algorithm determines whether a home is overassessed or not based on the unique rules imposed by the local assessor. By design, the GetSavings API will not tell you whether a candidate property is overassessed or not.\nValueAppeal Estimated Savings\nIf ValueAppeal\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds proprietary algorithm determines a candidate property is overassessed, we us the relevant local property tax rate to calculate the estimated savings the homeowner would realize by filing an appeal to have their assessment lowered.\nNote: Some jurisdictions reassess properties every year, while other jurisdictions reassess properties on a two, three, or four + year cycle. If the candidate property is in a multi-year jurisdiction we multiply the single year estimated savings by the number of years left until the next reassessment to determine the total estimated savings which would be realized by filing a successful appeal.\nSummary:\nThe vast majority of calls to the GetSavings API should receive a 0 result. In order to receive a non-zero API result the candidate property must be both inside it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Appeal Window and Overassessed.",

Data is held in a reliable and safe environment and the API enables development of a vast range of information rich applications. The Platform works like a shared database capable of storing and searching both content and RDF metadata. Because the Platform infrastructure is shared every customer can immediately benefit from any improvements we make in performance or capacity. We continually improve the Platform and release new versions every month without disrupting or degrading service to applications relying on it. This means application developers can forget about downloading and upgrading and concentrate user experience and value.\nData held in the platform is organised into \"stores\" which can be individually secured if need be. Any kind of content can be added to a store along with arbitrary RDF metadata. The content and metadata becomes immediately accessible over the Web and discoverable using both SPARQL and a free text search system with built in ranking of results according to relevance to the search terms. RDF provides a powerful and flexible data model which encourages linking and sharing of data and dramatically reduces the complexity of data integration. Because each store provides a uniform Web API regardless of the type of data it holds the Talis Platform gives unparalleled opportunities for reuse and remixing of data. The uniform Web API allows applications to easily search multiple stores of data, and the use of RDF enables the application to interpret and use the results with very little effort. This means that developers using the Talis Platform benefit immediately from an ecosystem of data and services that enable rapid development of applications with a strategy to continually evolve and improve them as they incorporate new types and sources of data.",

    "description": "By using the PriceGrabber XML API, you gain instant access to millions of products and offers, PriceGrabber\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds categories/taxonomy, but also (depending on the level of API access that you receive), access to product full descriptions and specs, user and merchant reviews, coupons and rebates, and much more.\nThe PriceGrabber XML API is a REST-based API, which means that you will programmatically get access to the PriceGrabber catalog simply by sending requests over HTTP following a specific syntax, similarly to how a browser retrieves a web page from a website. You will receive responses from the API in an XML format. XML is a standard that allows programs to describe data independently from the language or platform a site or application is running on.\nBecause using a REST API requires some basic programming knowledge, including understanding of the HTTP protocol and parsing of XML documents, you will need to possess these skills or request help from someone who does to be able to integrate PriceGrabber data into your site or application.\nXML API Access:\nYou first and foremost need to request access to our API. You will be given a partner ID (pid) and special key that you will use to access the API. You will initially be asked to send your API requests to a development server where you will be able to test the XML API and start building your application.\nPlease note that this test environment is not meant to support a large amount of XML API requests. You should never attempt any type of performance or load tests, nor should you drive high levels of traffic to it. If you have specific requirements regarding the service levels of our XML API, please check with your account manager to see what options are available.\nOnce you are satisfied with your implementation, one of our experts will review your integration and provide feedback, suggestions or request changes to make sure that your website or application is using the API correctly and as optimally as possible. Upon completion of this review, you will be granted access to our production environment and will change your API request domain.\nGetting information from our XML API is simple as calling the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsearch_xml.php?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd URL and passing a series of parameters that are detailed in the next section. Each parameter is separated from the previous one by a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd&\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd sign and each parameter works as a name=value pair. Parameters have different meanings and purposes that will allow you to flexibly search products, offers or other content within the PriceGrabber catalog.",

FeedBurner is a web feed management provider that provides custom RSS feeds and management tools to bloggers, podcasters, and other web-based content publishers. Using the features this library provides, anyone with a FeedBurner account may perform some of the most common actions available on the service programmatically.\nCurrently the library contains three APIs:\nThe FeedFlare API allows anyone to develop new FeedFlare units that tag, share, and interact with syndicated content, wherever it goes. Using FlareAPI to create new units can be as simple as displaying a link to related content, or as powerful as incorporating another web service.\nThe FeedBurner Awareness API allows publishers of FeedBurner feeds to reuse the detailed traffic statistics captured for any of their feeds. Third-party applications and web services that consume feeds can leverage this data to provide feed awareness statistics to potential subscribers. FeedBurner captures traffic data at an overall level for every feed. Feeds that have item-level tracking enabled have access to much more detailed data at the individual item level. This data includes \"resyndication\" information, which is very useful for determining where and how a feed is being consumed.\nThe FeedBurner Management API allows publishers of FeedBurner feeds to create and manage feeds within their FeedBurner accounts. Currently, the Feed Management API is offered only to Google partners who were previously under contract with FeedBurner.\nFeedBurner web services use the REST protocol to receive requests and return data over HTTP. Data is exchanged as plain text XML which can be repurposed, transformed, and displayed by applications that you build.",
